However, his Earth-based public image has become increasingly polarized, making it critical to assess whether he still evokes trust and admiration, or now sparks mockery or fear, among potential Martian recruits.\n","\n","To maintain intergalactic budget discipline and remain on schedule, IBB assigned the mission to a junior Earthling data scientist — operating under significant time constraints and with limited computational credits.\n","\n","Given these constraints, the team opted for a lightweight yet interpretable machine learning model: **Logistic Regression**. While less complex than sentiment engines like BERT, this model offers clarity and agility — qualities well-suited for this high-frequency Martian audit.\n","\n","Despite its simplicity, the system successfully processed a representative sample of labeled tweets, extracted emotional signals with reasonable accuracy, and scaled predictions across a corpus of **500,000 real Earthling tweets**.\n","\n","The result: a **baseline emotional footprint** of the Subject’s Earth reputation — just enough to illuminate the prevailing sentiment frequencies across the Terran social sphere.\n","\n","📦 Full dataset the project is based on: 500,000 Elon Musk Tweets on Kaggle:  [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clementdelteil/500-000-tweets-on-elon-musk-nov-dec-2022](https://) (JSON file)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"FdlpntjY-pqZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 0.
